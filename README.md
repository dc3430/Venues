# Venues
 An App to help you find wedding Venues for your special Day!

# Intro
As we are planning our wedding, the main thing I notice when searching for wedding venues google would populate individual links for each venue. I wanted to provide you with a single location to search for wedding venues. That is how the idea for my app came about. I want to make finding wedding venues easy and along with being able to add venues. 

# Getting Started
You will need to login to the Website, once you have created an account you will have access to the venue and you can add a venue or select a venue from this page. Once you select a venue you will be able to see their contact info, location, you can email the venue, what hours they are open for showing the property versus hours they are open for weddings. You will be able to leave a review of the venue after your special day over.
