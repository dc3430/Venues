#### 1) Project Planning

A project consists of more than just code.

This project requires **planning** organized within a **Trello board** with the following **lists**:

-[x] **Icebox**: Holds user stories that have yet to be moved to the _Current/MVP_ list. All user stories are originally put into the _Icebox_, including both MVP and wish list stories.

-[x] **Current/MVP**: Holds user stories that must be completed to meet the minimum project requirements (MVP). Once the MVP has been met, additional user stories may be moved from the _Icebox_.

-[x] **Completed**: Hold completed user stories.

-[x] **Wireframes**: Sketches of each screens's user interface for the major functionality of the application.

-[x] **Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)**: A diagram of the app's models (one per data entity) and the relationships between them.

> User stories need to be formed properly using this template:<br>`As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>`. The _reason_ is optional if it's patently obvious.

#### 2) Project Source Control & README

The project must include a **`README.md`** file with the following sections:

-[x] **Introduction**: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more screenshots.

-[x] **Technologies Used**: A list of all technologies, libraries, APIs, etc. used in the project.

-[x] **Getting Started**: Links to the project's planning (Trello board) and the **deployed app** on Heroku.

-[x] **Unsolved Problems**: List any unsolved issues.

-[x] **Future Enhancements**: Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project.

#### 3) Application Technical Requirements/Deliverables

-[x] A **working** full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku.

-[x] Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack**: - MongoDB/Mongoose - Express - React - Node

-[x] **Have a well-styled interactive front-end** that communicates with the **Express** backend via AJAX.

-[x] Implement token-based **authentication**. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.

-[x] Implement **authorization** by restricting CUD data functionality to appropriately authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

-[x] **Have a comprehensive feature-set**. For example, **if the app does not include full-CRUD** data operations, **ensure the addition** of one or more of the following: - Consume a third-party API. - Utilize multi-user, real-time communications. - Include _admin_ features.

#### 4) Project Feedback
 
 Dan, you made some great progress going into the final hours of project week. I think you have a really solid project here, with a few more days of work you could truly have an incredible portfolio piece. I like that you do have a flushed out server. Its organized, and you have full crud on the venues model to say the least. Further more your front-end has everything it needs to interact with the app's data. I would suggest flushing out the styles more, especially with respect to your form. I also think that changing the color scheme to something more accessible would also be a great boon. If you need inspiration for design, look up any design standard. Most companies release it for free for newer developers and designers to get inspiration.
